function y=wt(x,h,g,scales,del1,del2)
% WT   Discrete Wavelet Transform.
% 
%      WT(X,H,G,SCALES) calculates the wavelet transform of vector X.  If X
%      is a matrix (2D), WT will calculate the one dimensional wavelet
%      transform of each row vector. The second argument H is the lowpass
%      filter and the third argument G the highpass filter.
%
%      The output vector contains the coefficients of the DWT ordered from
%      the low pass residue at scale SCALES to the coefficients at the
%      lowest scale, as the following example ilustrates:
%
%      Output vector (k=3):
%
%      [------|------|------------|------------------------]
%	  |	  |	   |		    |
%	  |	  |	   |		    `-> 1st scale coefficients 
% 	  |	  |	   `-----------> 2nd scale coefficients
%	  |	  `--------------------> 3rd scale coefficients
%	  `----------------> Low pass residue  at 3rd scale 
%
%       
%      If X is a matrix, the result will be another matrix with 
%      the same number of rows, holding each one its respective 
%      transformation.
%
%      WT (X,H,G,SCALES,DEL1,DEL2) calculates the wavelet transform of
%      vector X, but also allows the user to change the alignment of the
%      outputs with respect to the input signal. This effect is achieved by
%      setting to DEL1 and DEL2 the delays of H and G respectively. The
%      default values of DEL1 and DEL2 are calculated using the function
%      WTCENTER.
%
% This function is a wrapper for wtnd, for compatibility with UviWave. See
