% FORMAT t = do_iwtx(t, h, g, dlp, dhp) 
%  
% Calculates the first-scale 1D wavelet transform along the X dimension of
% matrix t. The second argument rh is the analysis lowpass filter and the
% third argument rh is the analysis highpass filter.
%  
% dlp, dhp are the delays for the low-pass and high-pass filters.
