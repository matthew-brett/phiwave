%   IWT  Discrete Inverse Wavelet Transform.
%
%        IWT (WX,RH,RG,K) calculates the 1D inverse wavelet transform 
%        of vector WX, which should be a K-scales direct wavelet
%        transform. If WX is a matrix, then it's supposed to hold a
%        wavelet transform vector in each of its rows, and every one
%        of them will be inverse transformed. The second argument RH 
%        is the synthesis lowpass filter and the third argument RG the 
%        synthesis highpass filter. 
%
%        IWT will calculate the size of the reconstructed vector(s) the
%        largest as possible (maybe 1 point larger than the original)
%        unless it is provided using IWT(WX,RH,RG,K,SIZ). A value of
%        0 for SIZ is the same as ommiting it.
%
%
%        IWT can be used to perform a single process of multiresolution
%        analysis. The way to do it is by selecting the scales whose
%        highpass bands (detail signals) should be ignored for 
%        reconstruction.
%
%        Using IWT(WX,RH,RG,K,SIZ,KL) where KL is a K-sized vector,
%        1's or 0's. An i-th coefficient of 0 means that the i-th scale 
%        detail (starting from the deepest) should be ignored. KL vector 
%        can be replaced by a single number for selecting just only the 
%        KL deepest scales.
%
%        An all-ones vector, or a single number equal to K, is the same 
%        as the normal inverse transform. 
%         
%	 IWT (WX,RH,RG,K,SIZ,KL,DEL1,DEL2) calculates the inverse
%        transform or performs the multiresolution analysis, but allowing
%        the users to change the alignment of the outputs with respect to 
%        the input signal. This effect is achieved by setting to DEL1 and 
%        DEL2 the analysis delays of H and G respectively, and calculating
%        the complementary delays for synthesis filters RH and RG. The 
%        default values of DEL1 and DEL2 are calculated using the function 
%        WTCENTER.

% Restrictions:
%
%   - Synthesis filters from the same set as in analysis must be used.
%     If forced delays were used in analysis, the same delays should
%     be forced in synthesis (iwt calculates the complementary ones), 
%     so as to get a perfect vector reconstruction (or the equivalent 
%     in the case of not full reconstruction).
%
%   - The number of scales indicated in K, must match the number of 
%     them specified in the analysis process. Otherwise, the 
%     reconstruction will be absolutely erroneous. The same is
%     applied to the original vector size SIZ, but if it's not given,
%     or it's set to zero, IWT will give the recostructed vector the
%     largest size as possible.
