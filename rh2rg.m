function [rh,rg,h,g]=rh2rg(rh)

%RH2RG    Calculates all the filters from the synthesis lowpass
%	  in the orthogonal case.
%
%	  [RH,RG,H,G]=RH2RG(RH) begins with the synthesis lowpass
%	  filter (RH) and returns the synthesis highpass filter (RG),
%	  the analysis lowpass filter (H) and the analysis highpass
%	  filter (G).
%	
%	  It is an auxiliary function for orthogonal filters design.
