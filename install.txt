Phiwave installation
--------------------

First download and install the latest version of MarsBaR
(http://marsbar.sourceforge.net)

Next download Phiwave (http://phiwave.sourceforge.net).

Unpack Phiwave into a directory somewhere.  This will probably give
you a new directory called something like phiwave-3.0 (where 3.0 is
the current version number).

Put this directory on your matlab path.

Make sure that mex file compilation is properly set up for matlab.

In the matlab console, compile the Phiwave routines with 

>> phiwave make

Now you can start phiwave with

>> phiwave
